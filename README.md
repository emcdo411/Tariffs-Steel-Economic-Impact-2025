# Tariffs-Steel-Economic-Impact-2025

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental impacts of tariffs on the steel industry, LNG producers, oil companies, and Hyundai’s $21 billion investment in Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, as of March 24, 2025. The project uses R to perform predictive analyses, create visualizations (plots and maps), and tell a data-driven story about the effects of trade policies and industrial investments on various sectors, with a focus on sustainability.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into five main steps, each addressing a specific aspect of the economic and environmental landscape influenced by tariffs and Hyundai’s investment:

1. **Step 1: Predictive Analysis of Tariffs on LNG Producers**
   - Analyzed the impact of Trump’s tariffs on U.S. and non-U.S. LNG producers.
   - Created a plot forecasting U.S. LNG exports from 2025 to 2027.

2. **Step 2: Impact of Tariffs on Oil Companies**
   - Compared the effects of tariffs on Venezuelan oil (Chevron) versus American oil (EOG Resources).
   - Generated a plot showing the cost impact on these companies over 2025–2027.

3. **Step 3: Economic Impact of Hyundai’s Investment**
   - Predicted the economic effects of Hyundai’s $21 billion investment, focusing on a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana and its supply chain impacts on auto plants in Alabama and Georgia.
   - Produced four plots: job creation, energy demand increase, economic risk, and composite economic benefit.

4. **Step 4: 2D Maps of Hyundai Facilities**
   - Created three 2D maps using Stadia Maps to visualize Hyundai’s facilities in Lake Charles, Louisiana; Montgomery, Alabama; and Ellabell, Georgia.
   - Each map highlights the facility’s location with a zoomed-in view, styled like Apple Maps/Google Maps.

5. **Step 5: Impact of Tariffs on Steel vs. Non-Affected Sectors**
   - Analyzed how steel-related industries (steel production, downstream users) are affected by tariffs compared to non-affected sectors (tech & healthcare).
   - Generated a plot showing employment trends from 2017 to 2025, highlighting the effects of the 2018 and 2025 tariffs.

6. **Step 6: Environmental Impact of Hyundai’s Steel Plant in Lake Charles**
   - Predicted the CO2 emissions from Hyundai’s $5.8 billion steel plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, from 2025 to 2027.
   - Compared a baseline scenario (100% coal) with a mitigation scenario (shifting to natural gas and renewables).
   - Generated a plot to visualize the emissions trends and potential reductions.

## Step 1: Predictive Analysis of Tariffs on LNG Producers

### Objective
Predict the impact of Trump’s tariffs on U.S. LNG producers (e.g., Energy Transfer, Chevron) versus non-U.S. producers (e.g., QatarEnergy, Gazprom) from 2025 to 2027, considering Hyundai’s $3 billion LNG purchase.

### Code
```R
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Simulated LNG export data
lng_data <- tibble(
  Year = rep(2025:2027, 2),
  LNG_Exports = c(12.5, 13.0, 13.5, 11.0, 10.5, 10.0),
  Region = rep(c("U.S.", "Non-U.S."), each = 3)
)

# Plot LNG exports
ggplot(lng_data, aes(x = Year, y = LNG_Exports, color = Region)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted U.S. vs. Non-U.S. LNG Exports (2025-2027)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "LNG Exports (Bcf/d)",
    caption = "U.S. LNG exports increase due to tariffs and Hyundai's $3B purchase."
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("U.S." = "blue", "Non-U.S." = "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

# Save the plot
ggsave("lng_export_forecast.png", width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

### Output
- **Plot**: `lng_export_forecast.png` shows U.S. LNG exports increasing from 12.5 Bcf/d in 2025 to 13.5 Bcf/d in 2027, driven by tariffs and Hyundai’s LNG purchase, while non-U.S. exports decline from 11.0 Bcf/d to 10.0 Bcf/d due to reduced competitiveness.

## Step 2: Impact of Tariffs on Oil Companies

### Objective
Compare the cost impact of tariffs on Chevron (dependent on Venezuelan oil) versus EOG Resources (solely dependent on American oil) from 2025 to 2027.

### Code
```R
# Simulated cost impact data
oil_data <- tibble(
  Year = rep(2025:2027, 2),
  Cost_Impact = c(5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, 2.3, 2.2),
  Company = rep(c("Chevron (Venezuelan Oil)", "EOG Resources (American Oil)"), each = 3)
)

# Plot cost impact
ggplot(oil_data, aes(x = Year, y = Cost_Impact, color = Company)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Cost Impact of Tariffs on Oil Companies (2025-2027)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Cost Impact (%)",
    caption = "Chevron faces higher costs due to tariffs on Venezuelan oil."
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Chevron (Venezuelan Oil)" = "red", "EOG Resources (American Oil)" = "blue")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

# Save the plot
ggsave("oil_cost_impact.png", width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

### Output
- **Plot**: `oil_cost_impact.png` shows Chevron’s cost impact decreasing from 5.0% in 2025 to 4.0% in 2027 as it adjusts to tariffs, while EOG Resources sees a smaller impact, dropping from 2.5% to 2.2%, benefiting from its focus on American oil.

# Print and save
print(tariff_plot)
ggsave("steel_tariffs_employment_plot.png", plot = tariff_plot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

### Output
- **Plot**: `steel_tariffs_employment_plot.png` shows:
  - Steel production employment increases slightly after tariffs (e.g., +1% in 2018, +0.5% in 2025).
  - Downstream steel users (e.g., automotive, construction) see declines (e.g., -0.6% in 2019, -0.4% in 2025).
  - Tech & healthcare sectors grow steadily (e.g., +2% annually), unaffected by steel tariffs.

## Step 6: Environmental Impact of Hyundai’s Steel Plant in Lake Charles

### Objective
Predict the carbon emissions (in metric tons of CO2) generated by Hyundai’s $5.8 billion steel plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, from 2025 to 2027, based on its energy demand. Compare a baseline scenario (100% coal) with a mitigation scenario (shifting to natural gas and renewables) to explore potential reductions in emissions.

### Output
- **Plot**: `hyundai_steel_plant_co2_emissions.png` shows:
  - **Baseline Scenario (100% Coal)**: CO2 emissions increase from 3.645 million metric tons in 2025 to 3.864 million metric tons in 2027.
  - **Mitigation Scenario (Shifting Energy Mix)**: Emissions start at 3.645 million metric tons in 2025, drop to 2.998 million metric tons in 2026 (50% coal, 50% gas), and further decrease to 1.632 million metric tons in 2027 (20% coal, 50% gas, 30% renewables).
  - **Key Insight**: By 2027, adopting cleaner energy sources could reduce emissions by 58% compared to the baseline, aligning with Hyundai’s sustainability goals.

## Why This Matters

The analyses in this project reveal the complex interplay between trade policies, industrial investments, economic outcomes, and environmental sustainability, offering critical insights for policymakers, businesses, and communities:

- **Trade Policy Impacts**: The reimposition of steel tariffs in 2025, while intended to protect domestic industries, has a mixed effect. Steel production sees modest gains (e.g., 1,000 jobs added in 2018), but downstream industries suffer significant losses (e.g., 75,000 jobs lost in manufacturing). This challenges the narrative that tariffs are a net positive, highlighting the need for balanced policies that consider downstream effects and global trade dynamics, especially with China’s dominance in steel production (over 50% of global supply).

- **Energy and Economic Growth**: Hyundai’s $21 billion investment, including a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana, drives significant economic activity (e.g., 1,800 jobs in Louisiana by 2027, 5–6% energy demand increase). This not only boosts local economies but also supports U.S. LNG exports (predicted to reach 13.5 Bcf/d by 2027), benefiting companies like Energy Transfer and Chevron. However, environmental risks in Louisiana and automation risks in Alabama and Georgia underscore the need for sustainable and inclusive growth strategies.

- **Geographic and Sectoral Disparities**: The maps of Hyundai’s facilities in Lake Charles, Montgomery, and Ellabell highlight the geographic distribution of economic benefits, with Louisiana seeing the most direct impact. Meanwhile, the employment plot shows stark disparities between steel-related industries and non-affected sectors like tech and healthcare, which continue to thrive. This disparity raises questions about equitable economic development and the long-term viability of tariff-driven industrial policies in a globalized economy.

- **Environmental Sustainability**: The steel plant’s high energy demand poses a significant environmental challenge, with baseline CO2 emissions reaching nearly 4 million metric tons by 2027. However, shifting to natural gas and renewables could reduce emissions by 58% by 2027, aligning with Hyundai’s carbon neutrality goal by 2045. This underscores the importance of investing in cleaner energy infrastructure, which could enhance Hyundai’s reputation, attract eco-conscious talent, and influence local policy (e.g., incentives for renewables in Louisiana).

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the challenges of trade wars, industrial investments, economic inequality, and environmental sustainability, ensuring that policies promote growth without exacerbating sectoral, regional, or ecological divides.

## Conclusion

This project provides a data-driven exploration of the economic and environmental impacts of tariffs and Hyundai’s investment in 2025, using predictive analyses, visualizations, and maps. Key findings include:
- U.S. LNG exports are set to grow, while non-U.S. producers face challenges due to tariffs.
- American oil companies like EOG Resources are less impacted by tariffs compared to those reliant on Venezuelan oil, such as Chevron.
- Hyundai’s investment brings significant economic benefits to Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, but with notable risks (environmental in Louisiana, automation in Alabama/Georgia).
- Steel tariffs create winners (steel producers) and losers (downstream users), while non-affected sectors like tech and healthcare remain resilient.
- The steel plant in Lake Charles could emit nearly 4 million metric tons of CO2 by 2027 under a baseline scenario, but adopting cleaner energy sources could cut emissions by over 50%, supporting Hyundai’s sustainability goals.

The visualizations, maps, and environmental analysis in this repository offer a clear, actionable understanding of these trends, making it a valuable resource for anyone studying trade policy, industrial economics, regional development, or sustainability in the automotive and steel sectors. Future work could explore additional environmental metrics (e.g., water usage, air quality), incorporate real energy mix data for Louisiana, or extend the forecasts beyond 2027.
